# Multi-Ordered-Binary-Trees
Study on Multi-Ordered Binary Trees in terms of performance and data management.
This study was done while taking the course Algorithms and Data Structures with focus on evaluating how the data structure may influence time performance and computational complexity on simple search and ordering operations.
